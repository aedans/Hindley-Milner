Hindley-Milner
==============

A Kotlin implementation of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. 
All sources are located in ./src/main/kotlin, and all tests are located in ./src/test/kotlin.
Feel free to look around, but don't try to use this as a library. It is not designed to be extended by the user.
If you want to use this in a project, the best solution is to copy the sources and re-write what is needed. 

Building
--------

    ./kobaltw assemble  # Builds the project
    ./kobaltw test      # Runs the unit tests
    ./kobaltw run       # Runs the REPL
